<div class="col_lg_4  col_md_6    col_sm_12"> <div class="hdiv" style="background-color:#b19cd9"> Chicken </div>Poaching is a gentle, “moist-heat” cooking method that uses water or broth held at a low heat—always below a boil, usually barely at a simmer—to cook foods of all kinds. The ideal poaching temperature is between 170°F and 180°F. It’s important not to let the cooking liquid come to a boil or even a vigorous simmer or else (for all sorts of science-y reasons having to do with heat and moisture) you risk ending up with a tough piece of meat. Remember, poaching is a low-and-slow cooking method. </div>
<div class="col_lg_4  col_md_6    col_sm_12"> <div class="hdiv" style="background-color:#e9967a" > Beef </div> Most cuts of beef roast at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes a pound. Tri-tip and tenderloin, cuts that cook at 425 F, are exceptions. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends cooking roasts to an internal temperature of 145 F with a three-minute resting time after the meat is finished </div>
<div class="col_lg_4  col_md_6_2  col_sm_12"><div class="hdiv" style="background-color:rgb(240,230,140)"> Sushi </div> I’ll be very honest and say that there’s definitely a reason why chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.

Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade sushi wins:

You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me. </div>
